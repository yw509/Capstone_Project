With the rapid advancements in large language models, their application in domain-specific tasks has 
become increasingly effective through techniques like fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and leveraging
vertical knowledge bases. This project explores using LLMs to automate the review and classification
of advertisement slogans, addressing scalability and consistency challenges in the current manual
process. Two approaches were explored: in-context learning, where the model learns directly from
labeled retrieved examples, and meta-prompting, which iteratively refines domain-specific policy
rules to improve classification accuracy. By improving and applying these methods, the proposed
system enhances efficiency and accuracy while reducing human bias and labor, demonstrating the
transformative potential of LLMs in automating complex, policy-driven decision-making workflows.
